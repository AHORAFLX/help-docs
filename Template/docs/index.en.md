# Create your help

To start understanding how to develop your help, we think the best thing is to start creating it—this is what this section is for.

## Get the Project Template

We’ll start by having you download this ZIP with the base structure that every Ahora help site will have.

Once downloaded, we’ll unzip the file wherever we want to create the help.

## Understanding the template

To understand how this template works, you need to know two things: its structure and the language used.

### Markdown

Markdown is simply an easy way to format text without needing to wrap everything in HTML tags.

Adding **h1** titles is as easy as starting the line with `#`, `h2` with `##`, and so on; links are written like this: `[like this](/page/to/navigate/to)`, and the same goes for countless other simple things.

Here you can get a quick overview of how it works:

In any case, to learn everything you can do, we recommend that after you've seen how the documentation project works, you take a look at both the [basic Markdown elements](./Markdown/BasicSyntax/) and the [advanced elements](./Markdown/ElementosAvanzados/).

But besides the basics, we also have [our own components](./OurResources/OurComponents/) and [our own classes](./OurResources/OurClasses/).

### Structure

The template structure is very basic. Inside the `docs` folder, all the files (pages) that make up the help documentation will be placed. Based on how they are organized into folders, the site will be auto-generated following the created template.

This template is customizable, but we should maintain consistency across our help sites.

To fully understand everything and start developing, visit the [file structure](./Structure/FileStructure/) section and then the [visual structure](./Structure/VisualStructure/) section.
